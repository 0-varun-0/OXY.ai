Oxy.AI is a platform that lets anyone create a custom visual AI expert for any task, without needing deep learning expertise or massive datasets. It's built on a simple, powerful idea: **your AI should learn like a smart apprentice‚Äîby asking you questions when it gets stuck.**

## The Problem We Solve

Building custom AI to analyze images is a superpower, but it's locked away from 99% of businesses. Why?

1.  **The Data Barrier:** Standard AI training requires thousands of perfectly labeled images. Most organizations don't have this and can't afford the time or cost to create it.
2.  **The Expertise Barrier:** It demands a team of expensive, hard-to-find ML engineers and complex cloud infrastructure.

Oxy.AI shatters these barriers, making custom visual AI accessible to everyone.

## ‚ú® Who is This For?

Oxy.AI is designed for innovators and problem-solvers in any industry, including:

* **Manufacturing:** For automating quality control and defect detection on the assembly line.
* **E-commerce & Retail:** For automatically categorizing products and identifying styles.
* **Healthcare:** For assisting researchers in analyzing medical images like X-rays or microscope slides.
* **Agriculture:** For identifying plant diseases or monitoring crop health from drone imagery.

## Our Solution: The 3-Step Path to Expertise

Our platform transforms the complex process of AI training into a simple, guided workflow that feels like a conversation.

### üìö Step 1: Give Your AI Its Homework

You start by giving your new "AI apprentice" its first assignment. You don't need a massive dataset, just a small, focused **Knowledge Base**. This can be:

* **A few example images:** "Here are 20 photos of 'cracked phone screens' and 20 of 'perfect screens'."
* **A relevant document:** "Here's our 5-page PDF guide on how we identify cracks."
* **A simple request:** If you don't have enough images, just tell the AI to **create more examples for you** using our synthetic data generator.

### üí¨ Step 2: Train Your AI with Smart Q&A

This is the core of Oxy.AI. Instead of you labeling endless images, the AI starts learning and then comes back to you with targeted questions about what it finds most confusing. This **AI-Guided Training** loop looks like this:

* The AI shows you an image and asks, "I'm not sure about this one. Is this a defect? **[Yes]** / **[No]**"

With each answer, the AI gets exponentially smarter. This process gives you a highly accurate model with up to **90% less labeling effort**.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Put Your Expert to Work

Once your AI has learned its task, it's ready for duty. You can:

* Use our simple dashboard to upload new images for analysis.
* Integrate the AI into your workflow using a straightforward **REST API**.

Your new expert can now analyze thousands of images or video feeds automatically, providing real-time insights and freeing up your team to focus on what matters.

## üíª Live Demo

Check out a live version of the platform here:

**[‚û°Ô∏è oxy-ai-demo.vercel.app](https://your-demo-link.com)**

*(Note: The demo is a work-in-progress and may use a mock backend.)*

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, decoupled architecture for scalability and performance.

* **Frontend:** `React` / `Vite` ‚Äî For a fast, responsive user interface.
* **Backend:** `FastAPI` (Python) ‚Äî For a high-performance, easy-to-use API.
* **AI / ML:** `PyTorch` ‚Äî For building and training our core models.
* **Core Architecture:** Inspired by **BLIP-2**, using a frozen Vision Transformer, a trainable Q-Former, and a powerful LLM to bridge vision and language.
* **Deployment:** `Docker` / `Vercel` / Serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run).

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Oxy.AI is under active development. Here's our plan:

* [x] Core AI architecture defined and implemented.
* [x] Backend API for data upload and model training initiated.
* [ ] **Frontend UI:** Complete the user dashboard for data management and AI-Guided Training.
* [ ] **Synthetic Data Module:** Implement the generative model to create new training examples.
* [ ] **One-Click Deployment:** Allow users to deploy their trained models to a live API endpoint.
* [ ] **Advanced Analytics:** Add a dashboard for monitoring model performance and predictions.
